# Development Process Standards

All implementation must follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) and "Tidy First" methodology.

## TDD Methodology

- **Red → Green → Refactor Cycle**
  Always follow this sequence: write a failing test, implement minimal code to pass, then refactor
- **Start with Failing Tests**
  Write the simplest failing test that defines a small increment of functionality
- **Minimal Implementation**
  Write just enough code to make the test pass - no more
- **Meaningful Test Names**
  Use descriptive test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")
- **Clear Test Failures**
  Make test failures informative and actionable

## Tidy First Approach

Separate all changes into two distinct types:

- **Structural Changes**
  Rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)
- **Behavioral Changes**
  Adding or modifying actual functionality

**Critical Rules:**

- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit
- Always make structural changes first when both types are needed
- Validate structural changes don't alter behavior by running tests before and after

## Commit Discipline

Only commit when:

- **All** tests are passing
- **All** compiler/linter warnings are resolved
- The change represents a single logical unit of work
- Commit messages clearly state whether the commit contains structural or behavioral changes
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones

## Code Quality Standards

- Remove duplication ruthlessly
- Express intent clearly through naming and structure
- Make dependencies explicit
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize state and side effects
- Use the simplest solution that could possibly work

## Refactoring Guidelines

- Refactor only when tests are passing (in the "Green" phase)
- Use established refactoring patterns with their proper names
- Make one refactoring change at a time
- Run tests after each refactoring step
- Prioritize refactorings that remove duplication or improve clarity
