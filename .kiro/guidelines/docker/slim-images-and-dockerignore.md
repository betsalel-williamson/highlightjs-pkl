# Docker: Slim Images and .dockerignore

## Problem

Accidental inclusion of unnecessary files (e.g., documentation, `.env` files) leading to bloated images and security risks. `.dockerignore` behavior can be misunderstood.

## Solution

* **Explicit `COPY`:** Only `COPY` files and directories essential for the application. Avoid `COPY . .` unless `.dockerignore` is very robust.

* **Effective `.dockerignore`:**
  * Place `.dockerignore` in the build context root.
  * Use patterns to *exclude* files/directories from the build context (e.g., `docs/`, `*.log`, `tmp/`).
  * **Crucial Note:** If a file is explicitly `COPY`ied (e.g., `COPY my_file.txt .`), `.dockerignore` rules for that specific file are ignored.
  * **Common Exclusions:** Always include patterns for `.git/`, `node_modules/` (if using multi-stage builds), `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, and temporary build artifacts.

* **Handling Sensitive Information (DO NOT INCLUDE IN IMAGE):**
  * **Never** `COPY` sensitive files (e.g., `.env` files containing credentials, API keys, private certificates) directly into the Docker image.
  * Instead, manage sensitive data securely at runtime using Docker secrets, environment variables (for non-sensitive config), or a secure configuration management system.

## Impact

Bloated images, slower builds, increased attack surface, and potential exposure of sensitive data.

## Takeaways

* **Be Selective:** Only `COPY` what's absolutely needed.
* **Master `.dockerignore`:** Understand its rules for effective exclusion.
* **Security First:** Sensitive data *never* goes into the image; use runtime mechanisms.
