# Docker Multi-Stage Build Strategy

* **Per-Service Dockerfiles:** Each Node.js or Python service has its own `Dockerfile`.
* **Optimization:** Multi-stage builds optimize image size and security.
* **Current Base Images:** Currently use official base images (e.g., `node:XX`, `python:3.12-slim`).
* **Future:** Will introduce hardened, organization-specific base images (`Dockerfile.base`).
